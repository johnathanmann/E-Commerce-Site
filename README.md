## Install
Feel free to install using GitHubs recommended clone methods or by downloading the code and opening it in your preferred text editor. Once installed use `npm i` to download dependencies.

## Requirements
You need a text editor of your choice, [MYSQL](https://www.mysql.com/), [Sequalize](https://sequelize.org/), [MYSQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2), and [Dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv). Additionally you need an api tester I use [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download).

## Summary
This application takes in user input from the api tester and inserts it into a MYSQL database. The user can add, create, delete and update the databases categories, products, and tags. They can also view everything in their database.
